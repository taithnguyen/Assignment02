## Pilot Usability Test
# Introduction
The Tangerine mobile application is used as a self-care journaling app that helps users keep track of their moods, habits, and thoughts. While the app is mostly simple and straightforward, there were a few usability issues discovered from the heuristic analysis previously done. First, the app seems to be geared towards a younger generation as well as a less formal setting due to some of the vocabulary and emoji icons used. This leads to a mismatch between the app system and real world concepts. Second, there is a lack of direction on the app that could hinder users' effectiveness of self-journaling. This is an issue of visibility of system status. Third, there is extraneous and unclear information regarding some of the important statistics (ie: the graphs or previous moods journaled). This is an issue of aesthetic and minimalist design where not all important information is easily accessible and unimportant information hidden. Thus, I will be conducting this usability test in order to gain user feedback on these 3 potential user issues by completing 3 tasks related to these topics. The goal of this process is to improve the user experience of this app as well as information on how to best optimize self-care journaling apps. The questions and tasks of the following survey are used to capture the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the user when using Tangerine. 

# Methodology
For the usability test, I will be conducting it in a quiet room of my house converted into a portable minimalistic lab. The recording setup will consist on bandicam on my laptop to capture the survey completion and participant video and an iPhone screen recording of the app being used. I will first introduct the usability test and then acquire informed consent from the participant. I will then lead the participant through the pre-test, test, and post-test questionnaires.

This usability test is intended as a pilot test.

# Reflection
This pilot usability test taught me a lot about both being a moderator for usability tests as well as preparing for questions/issues that may come up. 

For being a moderator for a usability test, I learned about not attempting to intervene with the participant unless completely needed. For example, there were times in which I was tempted to help point out some tips or ask leading questions but this would take away from the overall value of the test. In addition, it was difficult to figure out whether or not to let the participant read questions alone or to be sure to give out every single instruction. Lastly, another issue was trying to get the participant to be as open and expressive with their process as possible, since many people are not used to narrating every thought or action. 

As for designing the usability test, I learned that there will be issues that cannot be discovered through a brief and immediate test. For example, the app being tested was a self-care journaling app and many usability issues could arise from looking back at journaling from days, weeks, or months previously. These issues would only be discovered from asking users familiar with the app or from repeated usability testing. 

Overall, the pilot test went decently. A lot of the issues discovered from heuristic analysis could not be fully tested from this single test of a new user. However, I still learned a lot about how a new user may interact with the app and discovered issues that I would not have been able to find. Additionally, there were things to fix in the script, questions, and tasks that could be optimized in order to glean the maximum amount of information possible from a usability test. Further usability tests and new tasks would help in learning as much as possible about users experiences with self-care apps.
